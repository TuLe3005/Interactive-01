      <h2> “Balancing tradition and modernity, public duty and private faith, the United Kingdom and a global Commonwealth,” </h2>
      <p class=right>The Cabinet Office said.</p>
      <p>Foster + Partners’ proposal seeks to sit quietly within London’s oldest royal park, which borders three palaces – Westminster, St. James’ Palace and Buckingham Palace – in the heart of the British capital.</p>
      <p>Its plan will remake the park with a “light touch,” much like the Queen who “encompassed… periods of significant change, socially and technologically… with a light touch,” the firm’s celebrated founder Norman Foster said in an interview with PA Media news agency.</p>
      <p>A cast-glass balustrade along the bridge will echo the design of the Queen Mary Fringe diamond tiara Elizabeth wore at her wedding to Prince Philip. She later lent the tiara to her granddaughter Princess Beatrice for her wedding in 2020.</p>

    <h3>“very gentle presence at night, almost a kind of light lighting experience, and translucent and absolutely flat, hugging the surface of the lake so seamlessly.”</h3>
    <h3 class="author-name">_Foster_</h3>
    <p class="p3">Every effort will be taken to preserve the exisiting nature and biodiversity in the park, Foster added, with the bridge’s design avoiding the need for heavy building work or big excavations.</p>
    <p class="p3">It will replace a pre-existing blue bridge and have a “very gentle presence at night, almost a kind of light lighting experience, and translucent and absolutely flat, hugging the surface of the lake so seamlessly.”</p>
    <p class="p3">Construction of the memorial will be carried out in such a way that “the precious route across (St. James’ Park) will never be closed,” Foster added in a statement.</p>

    <div class="image2-subtitle">
        <p>A statue of the late monarch will stand at the newly-named Queen Elizabeth II Place beside Marlborough Gate, an existing entrance to the park, while a statue of Philip will stand next to a new Prince Philip Gate on the other side of the park. A planned statue of the couple together will also feature in the memorial.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, a contemporary wind sculpture created by artist Yinka Shonibare will feature floral designs inspired by Elizabeth’s coronation gown, according to PA Media.</p>
        <p>Gardens representing both the Commonwealth and the UK will “create spaces for reflection and coming together,” a statement released by Foster + Partners said.</p>
        <p>The memorial will aim to create a “gentler, quieter, more contemplative” atmosphere, “and an opportunity to rediscover, or perhaps for some to discover, the legacy of Her Majesty,” Foster told PA Media.</p>

        <p>The proposal was selected after a committee considered feedback from the public, stakeholders and cultural experts.</p>
        <p>Other shortlisted designs included a lily pad-inspired walkway, a bronze oak tree and a pair of gently curved bridges.</p>
